# Dijkstra Algorithm with Relaxation
Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using min heaps(Priority Queue) and adjacency matrix

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.(Wikipedia)

I modify the Dijkstra's algorithm to get the shortest path in a directed graph and get the one with the least amount of edges if there are equal paths.
